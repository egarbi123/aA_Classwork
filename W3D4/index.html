        <h1>Spaghetti de Pietro</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe was shared with me by a good friend who works as a chef in Rome, Italy. It combines his knowledge of working in the kitchen as well as the knowledge he gained from cooking as a child with his grandmother. The recipe is especially fun
            to prepare since it involves white wine, and once the bottle is opened it is best practice to enjoy some of the wine while preparing the dish. Please drink and enjoy responsibly.
        </p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol type=I>
            <li>First you want to prepare the sauce part 1.
                <ol type=1>
                    <li>Preheat oven between 300&ring;C and 400&ring;C, if you have more than an hour to let this sit I recommend using a lower temperature on this range, less time will require a higher temperature</li>
                    <li>Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and spread on a cookie sheet open side facing up</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle salt and sugar over the cherry tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Remove basil leaves from stems, put stems over cherry tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Place in oven</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Now to prepare the sauce part 2.
                <ol type=1>
                    <li>Get a wide pan, fill with a small level of olive oil and place over low heat</li>
                    <li>Peal a few garlic cloves and crush them, then place into olive oil</li>
                    <li>Put a couple of anchovies in the oil</li>
                    <li>Cut your spicy pepper into small bits, and add to olive oil</li>
                    <li>Stir contents regularly, after anchovies have dissolved you can add a small amount of white wine to the mix</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
